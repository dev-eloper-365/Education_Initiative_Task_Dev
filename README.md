# Task 2: Smart Home System

## Introduction

The Smart Home System is a Java-based application that simulates a smart home system, allowing us to control various smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks via a central hub. Users can set schedules, automate tasks, view device status & reports, and manage triggers.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of several software design patterns implemented in Java. It aims to provide a clear and concise understanding of how these design patterns can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing their benefits and practical usage.

## Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: `SmartHomeHub` implements `Subject` to notify `DeviceObserver` subscribers on state changes.
  - Implemented in: `com.smarthome.core`
  - Use case: Smart Home device status notifications (e.g., broadcasting on/off, lock/unlock, temperature changes)

  ![Class Diagram](Exercise2_SmartHomeSystem/classdiagramimages/observer.png)

### 2. Creational Patterns
- **Factory Method Pattern**: `DeviceFactory` creates typed devices using the `DeviceType` enum.
  - Implemented in: `com.smarthome.core`
  - Use case: Provisioning smart devices (Light, Thermostat, Door) with validated initial state

  ![Class Diagram](Exercise2_SmartHomeSystem/classdiagramimages/Factory.png)

### 3. Structural Patterns
- **Proxy Pattern**: `DeviceProxy` performs simple authorization checks before delegating to real `Device` implementations.
  - Implemented in: `com.smarthome.core`
  - Use case: Access control for device operations via a protection proxy

  ![Class Diagram](Exercise2_SmartHomeSystem/classdiagramimages/proxy.png)

### 4. Singleton Pattern
- `SmartHomeHub` is a thread-safe singleton (double-checked locking) providing a single point of coordination.
  - Implemented in: `com.smarthome.core`
  - Use case: Central hub as the single source of truth and coordinator

  ![Class Diagram](Exercise2_SmartHomeSystem/classdiagramimages/singleton.png)

## Exercise 2 Features

- Device control: turn on/off lights, lock/unlock doors, adjust thermostat temperature
- Dynamic device management: add/remove devices at runtime via the hub
- Scheduling: execute actions at specified times (with daily wrap-around)
- Automation: simple triggers based on device properties (e.g., thermostat temperature)
- Observer notifications to subscribed listeners
- Access control proxy for secure device operations

## Exercise 2 - Getting Started

Prerequisites: Java 17+ (JDK)

### Option 1: JDK Only (No Maven)
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Exercise2_SmartHomeSystem
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```bash
     mkdir out
     dir /s /b src\main\java\*.java > sources.txt
     javac --% -encoding UTF-8 -d out @sources.txt
     ```
   - macOS/Linux (bash):
     ```bash
     mkdir -p out
     javac -encoding UTF-8 -d out $(find src/main/java -name "*.java")
     ```
3. Run the main class:
   ```bash
   java -cp out com.smarthome.core.Main
   ```

### Option 2: Using Maven
```bash
cd Exercise2_SmartHomeSystem
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.smarthome.core.Main"
```

## Exercise 2 - Usage

Use the `SmartHomeHub` to register and control devices, set schedules, and define simple triggers.
Actions accept friendly strings like "Turn On"/"Turn Off" (also "on"/"off"); they are normalized internally.

```java
SmartHomeHub hub = SmartHomeHub.getInstance();
Device light = DeviceFactory.buildDevice(1, DeviceType.LIGHT, "off");
Device thermostat = DeviceFactory.buildDevice(2, DeviceType.THERMOSTAT, "72");
Device door = DeviceFactory.buildDevice(3, DeviceType.DOOR, "locked");

hub.addDevice(light);
hub.addDevice(thermostat);
hub.addDevice(door);

hub.turnOn(1);
hub.setSchedule(2, "06:00", "Turn On");
hub.addTrigger("temperature > 70", "turnOff(1)");
System.out.println(hub.getStatusReport());
```

Example status output:
```
Light 1 is On.
Thermostat is set to 72 degrees.
Door 3 is Locked.
```
