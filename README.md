# Exercise 1: Design Patterns Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive demonstration of six software design patterns through real-world use cases, featuring an interactive menu system and professional logging.

## Design Patterns Implemented

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Stock Market notification system with real-time price updates
- **Strategy Pattern**: Payment processing system with multiple payment methods

### Creational Patterns  
- **Factory Pattern**: Vehicle manufacturing system with type-based creation
- **Builder Pattern**: Computer configuration system with flexible component assembly

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern**: Legacy payment system integration with modern interfaces
- **Decorator Pattern**: Coffee ordering system with dynamic feature addition

### Key Features
- ✅ Interactive command-line interface
- ✅ Professional logging with timestamps and levels
- ✅ UML diagrams with PNG visualizations
- ✅ SOLID principles implementation

### UML Diagrams
Each pattern includes detailed UML class diagrams with PNG visualizations:
- Observer Pattern: ![Observer](Exercise1_DesignPatterns/uml/Observer%20Pattern%20-%20Stock%20Market%20Notification%20System.png)
- Strategy Pattern: ![Strategy](Exercise1_DesignPatterns/uml/Strategy%20Pattern%20-%20Payment%20Processing.png)
- Factory Pattern: ![Factory](Exercise1_DesignPatterns/uml/Factory%20Pattern%20-%20Vehicle%20Manufacturing.png)
- Builder Pattern: ![Builder](Exercise1_DesignPatterns/uml/Builder%20Pattern%20-%20Computer%20Configuration.png)
- Adapter Pattern: ![Adapter](Exercise1_DesignPatterns/uml/Adapter%20Pattern%20-%20Legacy%20Payment%20System.png)
- Decorator Pattern: ![Decorator](Exercise1_DesignPatterns/uml/Decorator%20Pattern%20-%20Coffee%20Ordering.png)

### How to Run Exercise 1
```bash
cd Exercise1_DesignPatterns
javac -d out *.java */*.java */*/*.java
java -cp out com.designpatterns.Main
```

# Exercise 2: Smart Home System

## Overview
A sophisticated smart home automation system demonstrating the integration of multiple design patterns in a cohesive, real-world application.

## Design Patterns Implemented
- **Observer Pattern**: Hub notifies devices of system changes
- **Factory Method**: Creates different smart device types (Light, Thermostat, Door)
- **Proxy Pattern**: Controls device access with authorization
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures single hub instance with thread-safe implementation

## Key Features
- ✅ Device Management: Add/remove devices dynamically
- ✅ Device Control: Turn on/off, lock/unlock, temperature control
- ✅ Scheduling System: Time-based automation with self-scheduling
- ✅ Trigger Automation: Condition-based device actions
- ✅ Security: Proxy-based access control
- ✅ Thread Safety: Concurrent collections and synchronized access

## Usage Examples

### Basic Device Control
```java
SmartHomeHub hub = SmartHomeHub.getInstance();
Device light = DeviceFactory.buildDevice(1, DeviceType.LIGHT, "off");
hub.addDevice(light);
hub.turnOn(1);  // Turn on light
```

### Scheduling and Automation
```java
hub.setSchedule(1, "19:00", "turnOn");
hub.addTrigger("temperature > 75", "turnOff(1)");
```

### How to Run Exercise 2
```bash
cd Exercise2_SmartHomeSystem
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.smarthome.core.Main"
```

# Gold Standards Implementation

## Logging Mechanism
- **Multi-level logging**: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG
- **Timestamp formatting**: Professional log format
- **Dual output**: Console and Java logging integration

## Exception Handling
- **Custom exceptions**: Domain-specific error types
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All failure points handled
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues despite errors

## Thread Safety (Exercise 2)
- **Concurrent Collections**: Thread-safe data structures
- **Singleton Pattern**: Double-checked locking
- **Synchronized Access**: Critical sections protected

## Performance Optimization
- **Efficient data structures**: Optimal collection choices
- **Resource management**: Proper cleanup and disposal
- **Defensive programming**: Input validation and null checks
